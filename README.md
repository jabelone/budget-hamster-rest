# Budget Hamster (AKA Code Network API)
![Beast Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Beast%20Mode-On-brightgreen.svg)


The primary purpose of this repo is to house the api used by any CodeNetwork platforms. The direction
that the api should head towards is still in discussions.

## Getting Started

There are four main tools you will want to help life get easier to dive into development:

  1. [Node](https://github.com/nodejs/node) (We are using [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm))
  2. [Yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn)
  3. [Docker](https://github.com/docker/docker)
  4. [Git Flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow)

### Branching Strategy

This project heavily relies upon vanilla Git Flow. [This](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/)
cheat sheet may help you.

Always send pull requests against the development branch and ensure that you have supplied sufficient
tests.
